# histroic-weather-api-and-database

This repo contanis a Flask web-app that visualises histroic weather data for melbourne. 

It also contains multiple Write programs to transfer data from the Open Weather API to different databases. 

I demonstrate how to write data to a Google Sheets spreadsheet using the Google Sheets API. I also demonstrate how to write your data to a MongoDB Atlas cluster programatically.

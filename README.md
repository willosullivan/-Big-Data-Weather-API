# histroic-weather-api-and-database

This repo contanis a Flask web-app that visualises historic weather data for melbourne. 

It also contains multiple Write programs to transfer data from the Open Weather API to different databases. 

I demonstrate how to write data to a Google Sheets spreadsheet using the Google Sheets API. I also demonstrate how to write your data to a MongoDB Atlas cluster programatically.  

I ike the idea of collecting lot's of different big data so in 5 or 10 yars I have a deep databsae and repository of data I can overlay with other time-series/sequential data to identify correlations and insihgts. For example, how demand drivers change as weather patterns vary :)

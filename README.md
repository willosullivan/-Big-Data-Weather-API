# histroic-weather-api-and-database

This repo contanis a Flask web-app that visualises historic weather data for melbourne. 

It also contains multiple Write programs to transfer data from the Open Weather API to different databases. 

I demonstrate how to write data to a Google Sheets spreadsheet using the Google Sheets API. I also demonstrate how to write your data to a MongoDB Atlas cluster programatically.  

I like the idea of collecting lot's of different big data so in 5 or 10 yars I have a deep database of data I can overlay with a clients time-series/sequential data to identify correlations and insights. For example, how demand for orange juice varies at your local cafe as weather patterns vary. With these insights, stock ordering managers can make better decisions about inventory :)
